# Overview MVVM Clean Architecture

**Task Manager** is built based on MVVM Clean Architecture suggested by Google for the best practice Android Development. This target of architecture allows the app to scale, increases the app's robustness, and makes the app easier to test.
Based on these principles: 
- [Separation of concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns): is the most important principle in Android particularly, in software developement general.
  It leads to creating a project with less conflict or overlapping between code implementation, and business logic as possible.
  To follow the rule, developers must answer questions for **What** of code implementation. Based on that, developers can define which implementations work with which concerns.
